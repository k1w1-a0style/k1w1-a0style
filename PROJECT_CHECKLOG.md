# Project Checklog

## Patch 213
- Fixed missing `githubApiUrl` import in `screens/ConnectionsScreen/hooks/useConnectionsScreen.ts`.
- Typecheck/lint/tests should pass again after patch 211/212 changes.

## Patch 214
- Fix GitHub repo/branch source-of-truth drift:
  - Prefer `GitHubContext` active repo/branch in CI Lite.
  - Persist repo/branch into `ProjectContext` during backup import so hydration cannot snap back.
